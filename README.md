# MicroGrad
MicroGrad engine is able calculate derivative of every element to a spesific element in a set with a single function. It currently support 3 operations between elements which are: Addition, substraction, pow, exponentiation, multiplication and Tanh. I have also implemented an MLP engine using MicroGrad. Similar but complexer engines are used in machine learning libraries. It is heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micro-grad engine
